        <h2>Intro</h2>
        Are you buying a water filter or would you like to understand more about water filters?
        Then you are on the right page. On this page, I will guide you through various filters in water filters and their uses. In the end, I will also provide a few of my product recommendations, which could be helpful for you while selecting the models.
        <h2>Basic Overview</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>
                Firstly check the TDS of the water that you would like to filter ( ground water/ bore water/ well water/ municipal water ).
                You can purchase it from here :  <a href="https://amzn.eu/d/aER8WR4">https://amzn.eu/d/aER8WR4</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                Check out the below image to know about your water. If the TDS of water is below 300, then you must not buy an RO.
                UF + UV will suffice. If it is more than 300 then buy RO + UV + Mineraliser or NF + UV + Mineraliser (optional) <br/><br/>
                <img src="../images/im2.jpg" alt="various TDS levels" />
            </li>
            <li>
                TDS adjuster or MTDS controller and the worst things to have in a water filter. 
                They just mix up the impure water with pure water and adjusts the TDS, just for the namesake of adjusting the TDS. It's the worst thing to mix up both impure and pure water.
            </li>
        </ul> 
        <h2>Major types of filters used in water filters</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>RO : </b>
                This filter removes dissolved solids, metal particles such as arsenic, fluoride, and lead, and disease-causing microbes such as bacteria and viruses from water. In the end, we get water devoid of these all. It removes the dead pathogens too. This filter has very small pores
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>UF : </b>                
                UF also works similarly to RO, but it has big pores which don't remove everything as RO but remove enough microorganisms and a few dissolved solids.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>UV : </b> 
                This filter is like e-boiling.It's a UV lamp that passes UV rays through the water, which kills micro-organisms.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>NF : </b> 
                Nanofiltration is the best choice for mineral-rich and healthy water if your water supply has TDS up to 1200
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Mineraliser : </b> 
                It adds essential minerals such as Magnesium, Calcium, etc into the water.
            </li>                       
        </ol>
